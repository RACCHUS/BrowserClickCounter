# Plan: Add a Pause Button and Improve Expanded View Button Layout

## Problem
- There is currently no pause button to temporarily halt click counting without resetting the session.
- The collapse button is short and may not be visually balanced with other controls.
- The expanded view's button layout could be more professional and user-friendly, possibly requiring restructuring for clarity and aesthetics.

## Goals
1. Add a dedicated Pause/Resume button to the expanded view.
2. Ensure the Pause button clearly indicates its state (paused/resumed) and is visually distinct.
3. Improve the layout of all control buttons in the expanded view for a more professional, user-friendly appearance.
4. Make the Collapse button visually consistent with other controls.

## Steps
1. Review the current button arrangement in the expanded view of `gui.py`.
2. Design a new button layout:
    - Group related actions (Start, Pause/Resume, Reset) together.
    - Place region management (Draw, Manage) and settings (Save, Load) logically.
    - Ensure the Collapse button is visually balanced and easy to find.
3. Add a Pause/Resume button:
    - Implement logic to pause/resume click listening and timer.
    - Update button text/icon based on state.
4. Refactor the expanded view's button frame to use a grid or multiple frames for better alignment and spacing.
5. Test the new layout for usability and appearance.
6. Update code comments and documentation as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Expanded view includes a Pause/Resume button with clear state indication.
- Button layout is visually balanced, professional, and user-friendly.
- Collapse button is consistent in size and style with other controls.
- No loss of functionality or regressions in other features.
